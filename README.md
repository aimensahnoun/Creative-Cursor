# Project Workplan

This project is basically a copy of ScreenBrush considering Im broke and cannot afford the full version

 - [ ] Draw on the screen 
 - [ ] Allow the user to switch between fade-away and permanent drawing
 - [ ] Hotkey to remove drawing from screen
 - [ ] Write text on the screen 
 - [ ] Allow the user to switch between fade-away and permanent text
 - [ ] Zoom to an area
 - [ ] Allow user to add their own hotkeys

Planning on making the project using Electron for desktop considering it uses familiar technologies to make , and its a good way to learn Electron
